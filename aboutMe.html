                Hi.
            </h3>
            <p> 
                My name is MJ and I live in George Western Cape
                </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I have been teaching myself web development I use any and all resources at my disposal to expand my knowledge and most of what I have learned so far is not recognised as formal education but it is all that I have access to. I would love to have a opertunity to work and learn I think that is one of the best ways to learn.
                <br />
                if you are interested to see some stuff I've done you can find some of the projects I have done under the projects page &#x1F60A;
                </p>
            <p>
                I also have some "certificate of completion" to show some courses I have completed you can find them under Certificates. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose web development and design because I have a passsion for it <br />
                and because I love a challenge and finding solutions for problems and making something of practically nothing and I found all that in one place with web development and design 
                </p>
            <p>
                I am a fast learning, highly driven, energetic, comitted person who does not mind starting at the way bottom and working myself up.
